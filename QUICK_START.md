# üöÄ Quick Start Guide

Get your movie recommendation system up and running in 5 minutes!

## Prerequisites Checklist

- [ ] Python 3.8+ installed
- [ ] pip package manager
- [ ] Internet connection (for downloading dataset and packages)

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Download Dataset (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata
2. Click "Download" (you may need to create a free Kaggle account)
3. Extract the ZIP file
4. Copy `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv` to this folder

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies (1 minute)

Open terminal/command prompt in this folder and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Models (2-3 minutes)

Run the Jupyter notebook:

**Option A: Using Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook movie_recommender.ipynb
```
Then click "Run All" or run cells one by one.

**Option B: Using VS Code**
- Open `movie_recommender.ipynb` in VS Code
- Click "Run All" at the top

**What this does:**
- Loads and processes 4,800 movies
- Creates recommendation model
- Generates `movies.pkl` and `similarity.pkl`

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Test the System (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python test_recommender.py
```

This will run tests to ensure everything works correctly.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Launch the Web App (30 seconds)

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## üéØ Your First Recommendation

1. Select a movie from the dropdown (try "Avatar" or "The Dark Knight")
2. Click "Get Recommendations"
3. See 5 similar movies instantly!

## üñºÔ∏è Adding Movie Posters (Optional)

To display movie posters instead of placeholder images:

1. Get free TMDB API key:
   - Sign up at https://www.themoviedb.org/
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí API
   - Request API Key (Developer)
   - Copy your API key

2. Open `app.py` and replace:
   ```python
   TMDB_API_KEY = "YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY_HERE"
   ```
   with your actual key.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Problem: "FileNotFoundError: movies.pkl"
**Solution:** Run the Jupyter notebook first (Step 3)

### Problem: "No module named 'streamlit'"
**Solution:** Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Problem: "Dataset not found"
**Solution:** Download CSV files from Kaggle (Step 1)

### Problem: Jupyter notebook won't open
**Solution:** Install Jupyter: `pip install jupyter notebook`

## üì± Using the Streamlit App

### Features:
- **Dropdown Selection**: Choose from 4,800+ movies
- **Text Search**: Type movie name in the expander
- **Instant Results**: Get recommendations in < 1 second
- **Movie Posters**: Visual display of recommendations (with API key)
- **Sidebar Info**: View system statistics

### Tips:
